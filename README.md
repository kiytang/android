# Android Logo

## The Odin Project- Website 101-Front-End Exercise

###Aim:
The aim of this exercise was to follow the tutorial provided by [CSS3 Android Logo](http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/css3-android-logo) which allows one to recreate the android logo using:

* HTML
* CSS

###Other details:
The original code was created by [Diogo CorrÃªa](https://github.com/diogocorrea)

Note: For my version, I included additional hover movements on the robot's legs and in the codepen version referenced above, I tested some colours.

Please find below a screen-shot of my version:
